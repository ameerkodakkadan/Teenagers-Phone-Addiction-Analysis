# Teenagers' Phone Addiction Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project studies how teenagers use smartphones and how it affects their sleep, academic performance, and overall well-being. The goal is to identify high-risk students based on usage hours, sleep patterns, and grades, and provide insights for healthier digital habits.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze smartphone usage patterns among teenagers  
- Measure impact on **sleep duration** and **academic performance**  
- Compare addiction levels across **age groups, genders, and grades**  
- Identify **high-risk students** (excessive usage, poor sleep, low grades)  
- Validate findings with **statistical tests**  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle – Student Smartphone Usage Dataset  
- **Age Group**: 13–19 years  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Daily usage hours  
  - Phone checks per day  
  - Sleep hours  
  - Academic performance  
  - Purpose of use (Social Media, Gaming, Education)  
  - Depression & Self-esteem levels  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **R Programming** → Statistical testing (T-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, F-test, Z-test)  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards and storytelling  

## 🔎 Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized fields  
2. **Feature Engineering** – categorized addiction levels (Low/Moderate/High), grouped ages  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – trends across gender, age, usage purpose  
4. **Statistical Testing** – validated relationships between phone use, academics, and mental health  
5. **Visualization** – built dashboards to display addiction patterns and risk groups  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Average daily usage: **5+ hours**  
- **75%** of students check their phones **more than 50 times/day**  
- **283 students** identified as high-risk (high usage, low sleep, poor grades)  
- Educational use improves academic performance, while gaming increases addiction without benefits  
- Depression levels differ by usage purpose  

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Long-term (longitudinal) studies  
- Include psychological factors like stress and focus  
- Develop intervention apps to reduce screen time  
- Use machine learning for early risk prediction  
- Compare across schools, regions, and cultures  

## 📌 Conclusion  
Teenagers spend long hours on smartphones, often at the cost of sleep and grades. The study highlights the importance of balanced usage, awareness, and digital well-being practices.
